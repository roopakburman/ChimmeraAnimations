# retry

Abstraction for exponential and custom retry strategies for failed operations.

## Installation

    npm install retry

## Current Status

This module has been tested and is ready to be used.

## Tutorial

The example below will retry a potentially failing `dns.resolve` operation
`10` times using an exponential backoff strategy. With the default settings, this
means the last attempt is made after `17 minutes and 3 seconds`.

``` javascript
var dns = require('dns');
var retry = require('retry');
